# College Board Criteria
- **Program Purpose and Function**: To assist an ASB merch commisioner with the merchandise designing, tracking, and contacting processes.
- **Data Abstraction**: Collect orders and data (names and info) from customers
- **Managing Complexity**: Use a list with customer information (names and orders) and use a list for merch counting
- **Procedural Abstraction**: will define our own funtions for keeping track of stock
- **Algorithm Implementation**: will use iteration (lists for each funtion) and selection (if/else statements) and sequencing (step by step processes)
- **Testing**: We will test every aspect of our project (and often) to ensure we identify and correct our mistakes.
