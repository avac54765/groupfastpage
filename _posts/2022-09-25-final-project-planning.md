# The Idea

Our group wants to make a project that serves as a helpful tool for the ASB class to keep track of profits, quantities, and other things related to merchandise. 

## Steps for Completion
1. Make an outline of all the abilities this program will have
2. Decide what funtions/pieces we will need to accomplish this
3. Code, code, code!
4. *continue to use scrum board and process!*
