# The Idea

Our group wants to make a project that serves as a helpful tool for the ASB class to keep track of profits, quantities, and other things related to merchandise. 

## Steps for Completion
1. Make an outline of all the abilities this program will have
2. Decide what funtions/pieces we will need to accomplish this
3. Code, code, code!
4. *continue to use scrum board and process!*

Problem-based-learning program: Idea is around ASB Merchandise Commissioner Management. 
- A system where an asb user can keep track of merchandise.
   - merchandise stock

   - emails
- Attributes:
   - user input for orders and order descriptions (also customer name and email)
   - commissioner info (name, grade, position, etc.)
     - commissioner password (one password for everyone)
   - created a pre-written email draft off of a button to a specific customer
   - Use loops, variables, and lists to keep track of merchandise stock (have a return message for when reaches zero)
   - use JSON to make a table of all merch and customer info
   - HTML nav bars and menus
   - new page for merch designs, have a section for new ideas, in progress, and finalized desings (either have input for images or text imput of links to design pages)
